CssAnimation
============

Provides a simple wrapper around the CSS3 animation functionalities.


Introduction
------------

At the time of writing there did not appear to be a simple way to dynamically
generate the CSS3 keyframes necessary for animation within dart. Therefore
the appropriate rules must be built manually and injected into a stylesheet.

CssAnimation provides a simple interface with varying degrees of control
that can dynamically build animation rules and apply them to elements.

Once a rule has been built it can be applied to any number of elements
using the same instance of CssAnimation since it is simply using the
name of that rule.

A CssAnimation instance can now be modified, but if new instances are being
created continuously then call destroy() once an instance has been used
to ensure that the rule is removed from the stylesheets.

Please note that it does not attempt to fallback to javascript/dart driven
animations if the CSS3 capabilities are not there, it simply won't work in
older browsers.


Examples
--------

### Single property

The simplest constructor for CssAnimation allows the keyframing of a single
property.

```dart
import 'dart:html';
import 'package:css_animation/css_animation.dart';

main()
{
  var element   = query('#element-of-interest');
  var animation = new CssAnimation('opacity', 0, 1);

  animation.apply(element, duration: 500);
}
```

The apply() function has a variety of optional named parameters which provide
convenient access to the corresponding animation styles.


### Multiple properties

The starting and ending state of multiple properties can be declared
using Map<String, Object> where the key is the CSS property name and
the object is the property value. The value must convert to a valid
form via toString().

```dart
import 'dart:html';
import 'package:css_animation/css_animation.dart';

main()
{
  var element   = query('#element-of-interest');
  var animation = new CssAnimation.properties(
    { 'opacity': 0, 'top': '0px' }
    { 'opacity': 1, 'top': '8px' }
  );

  animation.apply(element, iterations: 2, alternate: true);
}
```

The example above will fade the element in at the same time as moving it down a bit,
then it will do the reverse (because alternate = true) before stopping (because
iterations = 2).


### Keyframes

An animation in CSS3 is defined as a set of keyframes (between 0% and 100%) with a
specific property state at each point. The most flexible constructor allows
any number of keyframes to be specified (within reason).

```dart
import 'dart:html';
import 'package:css_animation/css_animation.dart';

main()
{
  var keyframes   = new Map<int, Map<String, Object>>();
  keyframes[0]    = { 'opacity': 0 };
  keyframes[50]   = { 'opacity': 1, 'background-color': '#fff' };
  keyframes[100]  = { 'opacity': 1, 'background-color': '#000' };

  var element   = query('#element-of-interest');
  var animation = new CssAnimation.keyframes(keyframes);

  animation.apply(element, onComplete: () => element.appendHtml('finished'));
}
```

This time the example provided a callback function which is invoked
when the animation has completed.


### Modifications

CssAnimation supports rule modification. A property for a specific
keyframe can be changed.

```dart
animation.modify(100, 'top', '16px');
```

The modification will take effect next time the animation is applied to an element.
If a constructor was used that only specified "from" and "to" then there will be
keyframes at 0 and 100 respectively.

Alternatively, the CSS property map for a specific keyframe can be entirely
replaced.

```dart
animation.replace(50, { 'opacity': 0.25, 'background-color': '#888' });
```

Please be aware that each modification results in a rebuild of the underlying
rule, therefore excessive use may affect the performance of your application.


### Shadow root

If using CssAnimation from a component with a shadow root (such as a polymer
element) then the animation styles must be placed in that root instead of
the document head. Simple pass the "shadowRoot" to the argument named
"shadow" when invoking the apply function.
